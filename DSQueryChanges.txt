Using ADSIEdit
Using Active Directory PowerShell cmdlet
Using DSQuery
DSQuery is the preferred way to check the values of these two attributes quickly. To check WhenCreated and WhenChanged values for an object, type the following command:

DSQuery * “CN=TestUser,CN=Users,DC=<YourDomainName>, DC=<Com>” –Attr WhenCreated  WhenChanged

In the above command, we are checking values for a user account which resides in the Users container. When executed, the command returns the following output:

WhenCreated,                     WhenChanged
